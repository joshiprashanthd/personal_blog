Many of you have heard of Share Market but most of you are not informed about bond markets and how they work. This is the topic where most of us are not aware of. Our Indian bond market capitalization stands at $1.8 trillion in 2022. Buying bonds may provide fixed income streams and issuing bonds is a way to raise funds. There are number of reasons why bond market exists in the first place. Here investors (buyers of bonds) know how much money they will earn each year. Therefore it becomes very important to these things if you are trying to invest your hard earned money.

In this article you'll get high level details about how individuals, institutions, governments, and companies issues bonds and raise funds for their projects and how investors make money by selling and buying bonds on secondary market.

## Bond Issuance

It all starts with an entity wanting to raise funds for a project or to expand business operations or for some other reasons. This entity may be government sector or an organization. Raising funds is not an easy task to accomplish therefore some entities go for bonds as a means to raise money from public investors.

A bond market begins with issuance of bonds. Issuance bonds need to be discussed at length to decide how much money should be raised through bonds and how much an entity could pay as interest for these bonds.

These three things must be decided before issuing bonds.

1. **Principal Amount** (the money borrowed)
2. **Coupon Rate** (interest rate on the money borrowed)
3. **Maturity Date** (when the bond will be repaid)

All these three features are decided by the issuer.

<Note>
	Coupon Rate is a fixed interest rate which remains constant over the life of
	the bond
</Note>
## Primary Market

A primary market is where initial sale of a bond is performed. Initial sale if often facilitated by investment banks who helps issuer in determining the number of bonds and features of each bond based on market conditions so that bond looks attractive to potential investors.

Investment banks also helps in marketing the bonds in the primary market by using their extensive investor networks.

<Note>
	Each bond has its unique principal amount, coupon rate and maturity date which
	may or may not differ from other bonds issued by the same issuer.
</Note>

## Secondary Market

The secondary market in the bond market refers to the marketplace where already-issued bonds are bought and sold between investors. It is the market where investors can trade bonds with each other after the initial sale (primary offering) has taken place.

The primary use of trading on secondary markets is the liquidity it provides to bondholders. It allows investors to sell their bonds if they wish to exit their investment or need immediate access to cash.

The bond price can fluctuate based on various factors such as changes in interest rates, creditworthiness of the issuer and market conditions.

<Note>
	Just like share market, here brokers and dealers acts as intermediaries
	between buyer and sellers, matching order and executing trades.

### Clearing out a minor doubt

There's one more thing to be cleared out, that is if you buy a bond with price lesser than or greater than the original face value of bond, you'll still get the interest on the original face value of the bond.

Let's say bondholder has a bond of $1000 face value with coupon rate of 5% and market interest price are 2%. Obviously you intend to buy this bond which has greater coupon rate than the prevailing market interest rate. So you pay $1200 to buy this bond at coupon rate of 5%. Now if you think that you'll get $60 ($1200 x 5% = $60) interest then you are wrong. See you'll still be getting $50 interest no matter what you pay for this $1000 bond. It's face value (principal amount) does not change.

You buy this $1000 bond by paying $1200 because you get $30 more interest than if you were to buy $1000 bond by paying $1000 with coupon rate of 2%.

If it's bit tricky, don't worry I got stuck on this too, only thing you need remember is that paying higher or lower for a bond does not change the interest amount you get. The interest will still be calculated using the original face value of the bond.

Now, let's learn about some important concepts about how interest creates affect bond prices and how fluctuations in bond prices affect the bond yield.

## Relationship between interest rates and bond prices

The relationship between interest rates and bond prices is inverse. As the interest rates rises, the bond prices decreases and vice versa.

Interest rates affect the bond prices because any fluctuation in interest rates gives an opportunity to earn more interest on the existing bonds or you might lose some money by selling bond at lower price than the price you to paid to own it.

There are two scenarios, we have to look into it in order to better understand this relationship.

### Interest Rate Rises

A rise in interest rate, gives investors, well obviously higher interest on their payment. But it also affects the bond prices of those bonds having lower coupon rate than the prevailing market interest rate. Since the coupon rate on a bond never changes during it's lifetime, bonds having lower coupon rate look unattractive in front of new bonds with higher coupon rate.

Let's say you own a bond of $1000 with coupon rate of 5% and market interest rates rises to 7%. So you were earning interest of $50 but now there are other bonds with same face value of $1000 with 7% interest. So it gives other investors an opportunity to earn $70 interest on $1000, which is $20 more interest than yours.

### Interest Rate Declines

A decline in interest rate makes your bond more attractive because your bond will offer higher coupon rate than other newly issued bonds.

Let's say you own a bond of $1000 with 5% coupon rate and market interest rate declines to 3%. This means other newly issued bonds will offer $30 of interest for $1000 bond, which is $20 less interest than yours.

<Note>
	Do not think that if you do not sell your bond you will not incur any losses
	on your investment. Even if you don't sell your bond, you could still incur
	losses if the issuer defaults on the bond. This means that the issuer would
	not be able to pay back the principal amount of the bond or the interest
	payments.
</Note>
## Price-Yield Relationship

Previously we talked about how bond prices go up and down due to fluctuations in interest rate. You might pay more or less to own a bond irrespective of it's face value. And also the amount you receive as an interest remains constant irrespective of the purchase price of the bond.

The yield of a bond is an important factor to consider when investing in bonds. It can help you to compare different bonds, to determine the potential return on an investment, and to assess the risk of a bond.

There are different types of bond yield but will focus on three essential bond yields.

- **Current Yield**
- **Yield to Maturity (YTM)**
- **Holding Period Yield**

### Current Yield

The current yield is the simple interest rate that a bond holder earns on their investment. It is calculated by dividing the bond's annual coupon payments by its current market price. It is the more realistic way to measure the rate of return on a bond.

Let's say you own a bond of $1000 face value with a coupon rate of 5%. But currently the market price of your bond is $900. This means you are receiving $50 interest for $900 worth of bond. This obviously shifts the interest rate in the positive side.

**Current Yield = Annual interest payments / Current market price**

Therefore,
**Current Yield = $50 / $900 = 5.56%**

So _realistically_ you are earning interest at rate of 5.56%.

### Yield to Maturity (YTM)

Current yield is surely a important metric to look for but an investor always worry about the future. Current yield is not telling about potential return of a bond over it's lifetime. And an investor should always buy a bond which performs well in the long term. By long term I mean until it's maturity. One more thing is that we did not take into account principal repayment we get on the maturity of the bond.

Yield to maturity is more viable metric to know about potential returns of a bond. The easiest way to understand is to take an example.

So let's say you buy a bond for $900. The bond's face value is $1000 and has 5% coupon rate. It's maturity period is 10 years. So what we have,

- **Bond purchase price = $900**
- **Bond face value = $1000**
- **Bond coupon rate = 5%**
- **Bond maturity period = 10 years**

We'll receive interest of $50 annually over a period of 10 years. Additionally we are receiving principal repayment of $1000. Pay close attention to this, we purchase the bond for $900 and we receiving $1000 as repayment. This means, we are receiving $100 more than the bond purchase price.

We can pretend that this $100 are part of annual interest we get for over 10 years. This means we are getting $10 ($100 / 10 years) more annually. Therefore total interest we are getting is $60. So we have,

- **Annual interest = $50 + $10 = $60**
- **Principal repayment = $1000**

Since bond's market price may change during the maturity period. We don't at what price bond will be trading at the maturity. But we can calculate expected price of the bond by taking into account the current market price and bond's face value. So let's expect that bond's future market will be somewhere between the current market price and bond's face value. So let's take the average of these two,

**Expected Bond Price = (current market price + bond's face value) / 2**

**Expected Bond Price = ($900 + $1000) / 2 = $950**

Now to calculate all we have to do is divide annual interest we get annually by expected bond price to know the yield to maturity.

**Yield to maturity = Annual interest / bond expected price**

**YTM = $60 / $950 = 6.32%**

This means that an investor who buys this bond today can expect to earn an annual yield of 6.32% on their investment, assuming they hold the bond until maturity.

### Holding Period Yield

Holding period yield is simply the simply the total return that an investor receives after holding a bond for a specific period of time. It takes into account both the income and price appreciation of the bond. It's particularly useful when we want to sell a bond before it matures.

Let's say you purchase a bond with face value $1000 with coupon rate of 5% for $900. You keep this bond in your portfolio for 5 years.

Now,

Interest received for 5 years = 5% of $1000 x 5 = $250.
At the end of 5 years market price of this bond becomes $1100.

**Holding Period Yield = (total interest received + (current market price - purchasing price) / purchasing price**

**Holding period yield = ($250 + $200) / $900 = $450 / $900 = 50%**

Over the period of 5 years you have earned over 50% of what you have invested.

## Conclusion

So we have learned about what bonds are and how are they issued in the primary market and traded on secondary market. Then we learned about how interest rate fluctuations affect the bond prices and in effect brings variation in overall yield of a bond. I tried my best to keep things simple and did not use any weird words to make your head go around.

I hope that the wisdom in this article may spark the bulb in your mind about how bond market works. This was a very challenging but a very fun topic for an article, I really enjoyed writing this article. I hope you enjoy reading it too. Thank You.
